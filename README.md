# Clustering-of-BBC-News-Articles
Clustering BBC News articles using different types of vectorization, dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms. Then giving appropriate names to the clusters.

A zip file which contains summaries of news from BBC. The Data is taken from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/pariza/bbc-news-summary). 
Subfolders contains text files which have summaries of different news articles.
- Create Corpus from different .txt files
- Analyze and pre-process the article summary.
- Try different vectorizations.
- Try different dimensionality reduction techniques like Truncated SVD, tSNE etc.
- Build different clustering models with different clustering algorithms, vectorized data and reduction techniques.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of 3 models on basis of Silhouette Coefficient.
- Provide Visualizations for all 3 models. You can show scatter plots and bar graphs.
- Provide an appropriate name to a cluster label and explain observations.
